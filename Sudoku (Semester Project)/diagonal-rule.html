                    One of the reasons so many people love sudoku is because of
                    the simplicity of its rules:&nbsp;
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each column has to contain the numbers 1 through 9
                        exactly once each without repeating
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each row has to contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly
                        once each without repeating
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each 3×3 region has to contain the numbers 1 through 9
                        exactly once each without repeating
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    But what about the two 9 cell diagonals found in sudoku
                    grids? Must these two diagonals also contain every number
                    from 1 through 9 exactly once each as well?&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>In other words:</p>

                <h2>Does sudoku go diagonal?</h2>

                <p><strong>The short answer is: no.</strong></p>

                <p>
                    In regular sudoku there are no diagonal rules that state the
                    two 9 cell diagonals must contain all the numbers 1 through
                    9. There is however a variant of sudoku that does add this
                    rule as an additional constraint: diagonal sudoku (also
                    known as X sudoku).&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, unless you are playing this particular variant, or
                    any other variants with a diagonal rule, you do not need to
                    worry about the diagonals. Trying to ensure that the numbers
                    1 through 9 only appear once in every diagonal is likely to
                    make regular sudoku puzzles unsolvable as well.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <h2>Would a diagonal rule make sudoku harder to solve?</h2>

                <p>
                    It might be to think that the absence of a sudoku diagonal
                    rule would mean that the puzzle becomes easier to solve.
                    After all, it’s natural to think that the fewer constraints
                    the more possibilities there are.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, sudoku is a game where you must eliminate the
                    possibility of all the digits appearing in a particular cell
                    apart from a single digital.&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    The additional constraint means that you potentially have
                    more information to work with when trying to figure out
                    which digit goes into one of the cells along either of the
                    long diagonals.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h2>What about other diagonals in the grid?</h2>

                <p>
                    In terms of all the other shorter diagonals in the grid,
                    there are few if any variants that require you to pay
                    special attention to them.
